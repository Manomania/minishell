how to get starting of a string
lexer->input = str;
lexer->position = 0;         // Start at the beginning
lexer->length = strlen(str); // Store the total length

Access the current character with lexer->input[lexer->position]
Check if you're at the end with lexer->position >= lexer->length
Move to the next character with lexer->position++
